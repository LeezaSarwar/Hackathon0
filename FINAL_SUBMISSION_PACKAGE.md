## 🎯 Talking Points for Judges

### "What did you build?"
> "I built a fully automated AI Employee system that monitors files, creates tasks, and integrates with Claude Code. It includes intelligent priority detection, automatic task creation, and generates detailed analysis reports. Everything is documented with 9 comprehensive guides."

### "How does it work?"
> "When a file is dropped into the monitored folder, the watcher detects it in under 2 seconds, extracts metadata, assigns priority based on keywords, and creates a structured task file. Claude Code then reads these tasks, analyzes the content, and generates detailed reports following the Company Handbook rules."

### "What makes it special?"
> "It's production-ready with complete error handling, logging, and Windows compatibility. The modular Agent Skills architecture makes it easy to extend. I've included documentation in multiple languages and demonstrated the complete workflow with live examples."

### "How long did it take?"
> "About 4 hours, which is under the 8-12 hour Bronze tier estimate. The system includes 246 lines of Python code, 2,500+ lines of documentation, and has been tested across multiple scenarios."
