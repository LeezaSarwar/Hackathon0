## 💡 DEMO TIPS

### Before Recording:
- Close unnecessary windows
- Clear desktop clutter
- Increase terminal font size
- Test file watcher once
- Have DEMO_COMMANDS.txt open

### During Recording:
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Don't rush - take your time
- Show enthusiasm
- If you make a mistake, just continue
- Follow the script but be natural

### What to Emphasize:
- 8/8 requirements complete
- Live file watcher demonstration
- 3 watcher scripts for different channels
- Human-in-the-loop approval workflow
- 7 agent skills for decision-making
- Complete documentation and testing

### What to Say About Watchers:
"The Gmail watcher requires OAuth credentials from Google Cloud Console,
and WhatsApp needs QR code authentication. I'm demonstrating the file
watcher live as proof the system works, and showing the code for the
other watchers. The test results prove all components were tested
successfully."
