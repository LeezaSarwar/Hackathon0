============================================================
CURRENT STATUS - READ THIS CAREFULLY
============================================================

WATCHER STATUS: ❌ NOT RUNNING (stopped at 04:46:09)
API KEY STATUS: ❌ NOT SET (still placeholder value)
LAST ATTEMPT: Failed - QR code not scanned

============================================================
WHY YOUR TEST MESSAGE DIDN'T CREATE A DRAFT REPLY
============================================================

1. Watcher is NOT running right now
   - It stopped 15 minutes ago (timeout at 04:46:09)
   - It can't detect messages when it's not running

2. You never scanned the QR code
   - Watcher needs QR scan to login to WhatsApp Web
   - Without login, it can't see any messages

3. API key is not set
   - Even if watcher was running, no AI draft would be generated
   - API key is still: "your_anthropic_api_key_here"

============================================================
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW - 3 SIMPLE STEPS
============================================================

STEP 1: Get API Key (5 minutes)
--------------------------------
1. Open browser: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign in (or create FREE account)
3. Click "API Keys" on left side
4. Click "Create Key" button
5. Copy the key (starts with "sk-ant-")

STEP 2: Add API Key to .env File
---------------------------------
1. Open Notepad
2. Open file: D:\LEEZA\HACKATHON 0\silver\.env
3. Find line 35: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
4. Replace with: ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxx (your actual key)
5. Save file (Ctrl+S)
6. Close Notepad

STEP 3: Start Watcher and SCAN QR CODE
---------------------------------------
1. Double-click: START_NOW.bat
2. Chrome will open with QR code
3. Pick up your phone IMMEDIATELY
4. Open WhatsApp on phone
5. Tap 3 dots (⋮) → Linked Devices → Link a Device
6. Point camera at QR code on computer screen
7. Wait for "LOGIN SUCCESSFUL!" in terminal
8. Keep Chrome open (don't close it!)

STEP 4: Test It
---------------
1. After "LOGIN SUCCESSFUL!" message appears
2. Ask sister to send: "urgent need help"
3. Wait 30 seconds
4. Check: AI_Employee_Vault\Needs_Action\
5. New file will appear: whatsapp_[name]_[timestamp].md
6. Open it - AI draft reply will be inside!

============================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
============================================================

✅ You MUST scan QR code (don't skip this!)
✅ You have 20 minutes to scan after QR appears
✅ After scan, watcher runs forever (no timeout)
✅ Keep Chrome open while watcher is running
✅ API key is FREE ($5 credit for new accounts)
✅ Each draft reply costs ~$0.01 (very cheap)

❌ If you don't scan QR: Watcher will timeout and exit
❌ If you close Chrome: Watcher will stop
❌ Without API key: Task file created but NO draft reply
