Hi Sarah! Thanks for reaching out 👋

I'd be happy to help you with delivery information to Karachi. To give you the most accurate timeline, could you let me know:
- What type of product you're ordering
- Whether it's a standard or custom order
- Your preferred delivery address area in Karachi

Our typical delivery times to Karachi range from 3-7 business days depending on the product and location, but I can give you an exact estimate once I have these details.

Looking forward to helping you! 😊
