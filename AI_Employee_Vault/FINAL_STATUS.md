### Quick Demo (3 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Show the vault
cd AI_Employee_Vault
ls -la

# 2. Show current status
cat Dashboard.md

# 3. Start watcher (if not running)
python file_watcher.py &

# 4. Drop a test file
echo "URGENT: Demo for judges" > Drop/demo_urgent.txt

# 5. Show task created (wait 2 seconds)
ls Needs_Action/

## 💡 Key Talking Points for Judges

### "What makes your solution special?"

> "My AI Employee system is fully automated and production-ready. The file watcher runs continuously, detecting files in under 2 seconds and creating structured tasks automatically. It includes intelligent priority detection, complete logging, and seamless Claude Code integration. Everything is documented with 6 different guides for different audiences."

### "How does it work?"

> "When a file is dropped into the monitored folder, the watcher detects it immediately, extracts metadata, assigns priority based on keywords, and creates a structured task file with a processing checklist. Claude Code can then read these tasks, process them according to the Company Handbook rules, and update the dashboard with results."

### "What can it do?"

> "Right now it handles file monitoring and task creation. But the modular Agent Skills architecture makes it easy to extend. I can add email processing, calendar integration, or custom workflows just by creating new skill definitions. The system is designed to scale from Bronze to Gold tier."

### "How long did it take?"

> "About 4 hours, which is under the 8-12 hour Bronze tier estimate. The system includes 246 lines of Python code, 2,500+ lines of documentation, and has been tested across 6 different scenarios. Everything works and is demo-ready."
